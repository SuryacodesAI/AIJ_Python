# AIJ_Python
This project helped me apply everything from basic to advanced Python, sharpening my logic and coding depth—skills essential for my path as an aspiring AI engineer.

🧠 Advanced Tic Tac Toe — Python Project
A feature-rich, end-to-end Tic Tac Toe system built to strengthen Python fundamentals and advanced concepts, supporting my journey toward becoming an aspiring AI engineer.

🚀 Project Overview
This project is not just a game—it's a full Python learning pipeline. It includes concepts ranging from basic syntax to advanced modules, OOP design, data structures, error handling, algorithms, and modular programming.
It was built to enhance problem-solving, clean coding practices, and logical thinking essential for AI development.

🎯 Key Features
Advanced Game Logic — Includes win conditions, draw detection, intelligent turns, and reusable game functions.
OOP/Modular Approach — Clean class-based or modular function-based architecture (whichever you implemented).
Error Handling — Prevents invalid inputs, out-of-range moves, or wrong user entries.
Replay & Session Management — Lets users replay or restart the game without restarting the program.
Customizable Board Size (if added) — Allows classic (3×3) or extended board sizes.
AI Bot (if included) — Basic heuristic or rule-based agent for single-player mode.
Clean UI/CLI — Proper prompts, game status updates, and user-friendly layout.
